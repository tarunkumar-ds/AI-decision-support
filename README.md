Career Recommendation Advisor (AI Decision Support System)
 Overview

The Career Recommendation Advisor is an AI-assisted decision support system designed to help users identify suitable career paths based on their skills, interests, and strengths.
Unlike traditional prediction systems, this project focuses on explainable recommendations, guiding users with clear reasoning, skill gap analysis, and actionable next steps       


Problem Statement:

Many students and early professionals struggle to decide the right career path due to
unclear skill requirements
confusion between similar roles
This system addresses that gap by acting as a career advisor, not just a recommender.

Solution Approach

The system combines:
Rule-based reasoning (career knowledge base)
Weighted scoring logic
Explainable outputs
It evaluates how well a user profile aligns with predefined career roles and explains why each role is recommended.
